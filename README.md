Shame on the fork
-----------------

I promise I will copy 100x I won't destroy other's work in my fork. Now lets talk about serious business.

## Installation

# Cloning this repository

* The simplest option is:
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/gnthibault/siril.git
    ```
    This will download the submodule up to the version that is used in this project. To update to the latest commit of the submodule itself:

    ```bash
    git submodule update --remote
    ```

* One could also directly download the submodule from the source:

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/gnthibault/siril.git
    cd ./binding/python/pybind11/
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

* Dependencies for ubuntu
    See mainly here for dependencies: <https://free-astro.org/index.php/Siril:install>

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get -y install automake autoconf build-essential intltool libgtk-3-dev fftw3-dev libgsl-dev libcfitsio3-dev libconfig++-dev libtiff-dev libjpeg-dev libraw-dev libffms2-dev libopencv-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libboost-all-dev
    ```

mmary
-------
SIRIL is an astronomical image processing tool.

It is specially tailored for noise reduction and improving the signal/noise
ratio of an image from multiple captures, as required in astronomy.
SIRIL can align automatically or manually, stack and enhance pictures from various file formats,
even image sequence files (films and SER files).

Contributors are welcome. Programming language is C.
Main development is done with most recent versions of libraries.

Requirements
------------
 * **GTK+ 3**, (>= 3.6) as GUI toolkit
 * **cfitsio** for FITS image read and write
 * **fftw3** for Fourier transforms
 * **GSL** (The GNU Scientific Library) for PSF implementation, histograms and background extraction
 * **libconfig** (>= 1.4) for structured configuration files
 * **A C++ compiler** for opencv code and avi exporter
 * **libopencv** for various image transformation algorithms

SIRIL works internally with FITS files, but other file formats can be used as
input and converted using the conversion tab of the control window. Some file
formats are handled internally, like BMP, PPM and SER, some require external
libraries or programs listed below. Libraries need to be present at compilation
time, or their support won't be included.

 * **libraw** for DSLR RAW files import
 * **libffms2** for films import (any format supported by ffmpeg)
 * **libtiff** (>= 4) for TIFF format support
 * **libjpeg** or compatible libraries like libjpeg-turbo for JPEG format support
 * **libpng** (>= 1.6) for PNG format support
 * **libavformat**, **libavutil** (>= 55.20), **libavcodec**, **libswscale** and **libswresample** for avi export (usually provided by ffmpeg)
 * **libcurl** for the Web-based new version check and the astrometry solver
 * **gnuplot** for photometry graphs output

All these libraries and programs are available in most Linux distributions and
free systems, maybe with the exception of ffms2 that is not as popular as
others and may need to be compiled.

Scripting
---------

SIRIL accepts commands from the graphical command line, from scripts as a file
that contains a sequence of commands, or from a named pipe. The list of
supported commands is documented
[here](https://free-astro.org/index.php?title=Siril:Commands).

Some general purpose scripts have been made by the developers and some power
users, and are provided with the source code and some installers. When they are
in some default directories or in the directories defined by the user in the
settings, scripts appear in a top-menu of the main window. See [this
page](https://free-astro.org/index.php?title=Siril:scripts) for more
information about scripts and a list of scripts ready for use.

The named pipe is only enabled when using SIRIL in a non-graphical way and when
the `-p` command is passed to the program command line.

Source download
---------------

You can get SIRIL source code from the release archives on their webpage, or the latest version from git:

    git clone https://gitlab.com/free-astro/siril.git 

Building SIRIL for GNU/Linux
----------------------------
The process is the usual GNU/Linux package build; the configure script is not
directly shipped and has to be created the first time with the autogen script.
Run with the following commands:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    sudo make install

Note that a binary package for stable version of SIRIL is maintained for Debian. 
PPA repositories for Ubuntu and Linux Mint maintained by SIRIL's authors are
available in **ppa:lock042/siril**.

See the [download](https://free-astro.org/index.php?title=Siril:releases) page 
of the current version for other packages that could be available.

Building SIRIL for macOS
------------------------
We provide a dmg installer on the [website](https://www.siril.org/download/),
but you can also install SIRIL from source using homebrew.

    brew install siril

SIRIL on Windows
----------------
SIRIL is supported on windows since version 0.9.8. An installer has been
created by a SIRIL user and he maintains it. We only provide an archive
containing the binaries as the official Windows release.

You can also build it from source yourself with msys2, it is documented
[here](https://free-astro.org/index.php?title=Siril:install#Installing_on_Windows).

Translation instructions for SIRIL
----------------------------------
The translation system is based on [intltool](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/intltool/),
common for GTK+ software, with the help of the [poedit](https://poedit.net/) editor.

Get SIRIL sources. In the po directory, run 
     
    make update-po
    
Install poedit and open the **siril.pot** file in the po directory to start a new translation.

Proceed to the translation of the English elements in the list. When you want
to stop or when you have finished, send us the .po file that you created and
we'll include it in the next version's sources and packages.

Notes on SIRIL FITS image format
--------------------------------
[Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS) is an open
standard defining a digital file format useful for storage, transmission and processing
of scientific and other images.
FITS is the most commonly used digital file format in astronomy.

Since FITS is a container and doesn't specify the order and size of data, it's
useful to fix it at some point. Currently, SIRIL uses unsigned 16-bit per
channel values (TUSHORT), and images are stored channel after channel on a
bottom-to-top, left-to-right order.

All files imported and converted in SIRIL or files exported by SIRIL are in this
FITS format, except sequence files like SER and films, which are read from the
file and converted on-the-fly. Films should be converted to SER now to process
them, many parallel operations are unsupported on them.

Notes on image sequence files
-----------------------------
SIRIL makes a strong case for the use SER sequences against the generic film
containers that are not well suited for astronomy data and that may not be read
the same way by different players. SIRIL can convert any film format supported
by FFMS2 (probably all ffmpeg formats, which is a lot) to SER, and even any
image sequence to SER.

SIRIL supports SER v3. See [this page](https://free-astro.org/index.php/SER) for more details.
