SIRIL is an astronomical image processing tool.

SIRIL is aimed at providing an easy to use processing tool for astronomical
images. The intent is to provide free OS users with an equivalent of Christian
Buil's IRIS, only easier to use.

Contributors are welcome. Programming language is C.
Main development is done with most recent versions of libraries.

Adding new commands and features is basically independent from the GUI. You just
need to look at commands.c, siril.c and siril.h in the src subtree to see how
the stuff works, and how to add new things that can be integrated...


REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDENCIES

New Siril uses:

	* Gtk 3, (>= 3.6) for the GUI toolkit
	* cfitsio for fits related stuff
	* fftw3 as a FFT library
	* The GNU Scientific Library (gsl) for FWHM implementation, histograms
	  and background extraction
	* libconfig++ (>= 1.4) for structured configuration file management
	* g++ for opencv code and avi exporter

Siril works internally with FITS files, but other file formats can be used as
input and converted using the conversion tab of the control window. Some file
formats are handled internally, like BMP, PPM and SER, some required external
libraries or programs as listed below. Libraries need to be present at
compilation time, or their support won't be compiled.

	* libraw for DSLR RAW files import
	* libffms2 for films import
	* libtiff (>= 4)
	* libjpeg or compatible libraries like libjpeg-turbo
	* libpng
	* opencv
	* libavformat
	* libavutil >= 55.20
	* libavcodec
	* libswscale
	* libswresample

All these libraries are available in most Linux distributions and free systems,
maybe with the exception of ffms2 that is not as popular as others and may need
to be compiled on some systems.


The install is similar to the usual GNU/Linux package build, except that the
configure script is not directly shipped and has to be created and run with the
following command:

	$ autogen.sh

After that, it's just:

	$ make
	$ make install (with the required privileges)

Note that a binary package for Siril is maintained for Debian. See the download
page for other packages that could be available.


NOTES ON SIRIL FITS IMAGE FORMAT

Since FITS doesn't specify the order and size of data, it's useful to fix it at
some point. Currently, Siril uses unsigned 16-bit per channel values (TUSHORT),
and images are stored channel after channel on a bottom-to-top, left-to-right
order.

All files imported and converted in Siril or files exported by Siril are in this
FITS format, except sequence files like SER and films, which are read from the
file and converted on-the-fly.


NOTES ON IMAGE SEQUENCES FILES

Siril makes a strong case for the use SER sequences against the generic film
containers that are not well suited for astronomy data and that may not be read
the same way by different players. Siril can convert any film format supported
by FFMS2 (probably all ffmpeg formats, which is a lot) to SER, and even any
image sequence to SER.
Siril supports SER v3.
