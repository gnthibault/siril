.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSiril\fP is an image processing tool specially tailored for noise reduction and improving the signal/noise ratio of an image from multiple captures, as required in astronomy. \fBSiril\fP can align, stack and enhance pictures from various file formats, even image sequences (movies and SER files). It makes use of OpenMP, supports all the cameras supported by libraw, and carries out its calculations in a high precision 32-bit floating point engine.
