    * This is a generic transformation from one coordinate system to another.

    *
    *       x' = A + B*x + C*y
    *       y' = D + E*x + F*y

    *      y' =  G + Hx + Iy + Jxx + Kxy + Lyy
    *
    *   if linear plus quadratic plus cubic,
    *
    *      x' =  A + Bx + Cy + Dxx + Exy + Fyy + Gx(xx+yy) + Hy(xx+yy)

    *
    *
    *  The 'order' field of the TRANS structure signals which
    *  of the above cases is to be used.
	 *
	 *  The 'nr' field contains the number of pairs ultimately used to
	 *  determine the transform between the coordinate system.
	 *
	 *  The 'nm' field contains the number of pairs which -- after
	 *  the transform has been determined and applied -- match up,
	 *  and can be used to determine the quality of the fit.
	 *
	 *  The 'sig' field holds the standard deviation of the separation
	 *  between matched stars in the two sets, after they have been
	 *  transformed into the coordinate system of the second list.
	 *  Only items which were used to derive the TRANS are included
	 *  in this calculation.
	 *
	 *  The 'sx' and 'sy' fields hold the standard deviation of the
	 *  1-D separations between corresponding items in the two sets,
	 *  after they have been transformed into the coordinate system
	 *  of the second list.  A single iteration of 3-sigma clipping
	 *  is used in the calculation.
	 *  If the user specifies the "recalc" option, then the "sx" and "sy"
	 *  values will be based on all items which can be matched in
	 *  the two frames -- not just those few which were used to derive
	 *  the TRANS.
