 * <AUTO>
 * FILE: apply_match.c
 *
 * <HTML>
 * Given 
 *    - an ASCII file consisting of a list of stars, with one line per
 *        star and multiple columns of information separated by white space
 *    - the numbers of the columns containing "X" and "Y" coords of stars
 *    - a central RA and Dec, each in decimal degrees
 *    - coefficients of a TRANS structure which convert "X" and "Y"
 *        coordinates from the ASCII file's system to plate coordinates
 *        (xi, eta), which are projections onto the tangent plane 
 *        centered on the central RA and Dec.
 *
 * run through the data file.  For each entry, calculate the (RA, Dec) of
 * the star, then replace the "X" and "Y" values with (RA, Dec).  Leave all
 * other information in the ASCII file as-is.
 *
 * The TRANS structure converts "X" and "Y" to (xi, eta) in one of three
 * ways.  If the user specifies a 'linear' transformation (which is the
 * default), then
 *
 *     xi = A + Bx + Cy
 *    eta = D + Ex + Fy
 *
 * In the case of 'quadratic', 
 *
 *     xi =  A + Bx + Cy + Dxx + Exy + Fyy
 *    eta =  G + Hx + Iy + Jxx + Kxy + Lyy
 *
 * In the case of 'cubic', 
 *
 *     xi =  A + Bx + Cy + Dxx + Exy + Fyy + Gx(xx+yy) + Hy(xx+yy)
 *    eta =  I + Jx + Ky + Lxx + Mxy + Nyy + Ox(xx+yy) + Py(xx+yy)
 *
 * where "xi" and "eta" are in radians, and measure the distance
 * of the star from the center of field from which the TRANS was calculated.
 * We assume that the given "ra" and "dec" values are the same as this
 * central position.
 *
 * We force all values of RA to lie between 0 < RA < 360
 *
 * Print the results to stdout, or place them into the file given
 * by the optional "outfile" command-line argument.
 *
 * Usage: apply_match starfile1 xcol ycol ra dec linear|quadratic|cubic
 *                    a b c d e f [g h i j k [l m n o ]] [outfile=] 
 *
 * </HTML>
 * </AUTO>
 *
 * modified to assume that the TRANS structure takes (x, y) coords and
 *   turns them into (xi, eta), in radians, rather than in arcseconds.
 *   MWR 5/24/2000
 *
 * modified to handle the three cases of linear, quadratic, or cubic
 *   TRANSformations. 
 *   MWR 6/11/2000
 *
 * fixed equations in proc_star_file() so that they handle properly
 *   the coordinate transformations near the celestial poles.
 *   MWR 5/19/2003
 *
 * added 10 more %s in the "sscanf" statement in proc_star_file()
 *   MWR 6/11/2008
